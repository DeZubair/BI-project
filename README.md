This project is a business dashboard that allows users to analyze and present business data in a clear, concise and visually appealing manner. The dashboard is built using Power BI, which is connected to a database containing business data. The data is analyzed and cleaned using DAX, and then models are developed to filter the data. The dashboard includes various visualizations such as complete sale of business, sales in specific periods or years, the sum of quantities sold, average delivery days, count of returning orders, sales by segment and market, top 10 customers, top five profit and loss products, etc. This makes it easy for users to gain insights into the business and make informed decisions. The whole dashboard is fully responsive, making it more user-friendly and accessible. This project is a valuable tool for any business looking to analyze and present their data in a clear and professional manner.
